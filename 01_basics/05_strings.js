//console.log(`Hello, my name is ${name.toUpperCase()}, and my repo count is ${repoCount}`);//advantage of using backticks is string interpolation(we can create placeholders, directly inject our variables into them)
//This format is more readable and reliable
//This modern way is called string interpolation
//we can use functions on the variables as well like toUpperCase

// There is another way to declare a string as well

//console.log(gameName[0]);

//console.log(gameName.length);
// Returns length of string

//console.log(gameName.toUpperCase());
//for accessing functions mentioned within proto, we don't need to mention __proto__ everytime

//This function didn't change our original string, it just displays in upper case

//console.log(gameName.charAt(2));
//Another way to access character at specified index position in string

//console.log(gameName.indexOf('a'));
//This returns index of first occurence of the character in the string

const newString= gameName.substring(0,4); //0 is the starting index, 4 is the length of the substring
//console.log(newString);
//substring can't handle -ve values. 

const anotherString= gameName.slice(-15,4);

//can take substring between start and end indexes
